Add an option to your WooCommerce products to enable gift wrapping. Optionally charge a fee. For WooCommerce 2.0 +

## Description

This simple extension allows you to add a gift wrap option to your products with optional price.

WooCommerce > Settings lets you set up the default gift-wrappable status per-product and cost. These costs can be overridden per-product too.

If the customer adds gift wrap, it is shown in cart + orders, and adds your defined cost to the item cost too.

If you want to use the option to allow the customer only to have all product wrapped as gift, you first need to setup a product, that acts as gift wrap. This product will then define the price for wrapping all ordered cart items as gift.
